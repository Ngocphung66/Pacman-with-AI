THIS IS A PROJECT OF PACMAN GAME

It is implemented by a group of four people: Nhung, Ngoc, Lan and Lam

The source code is refered from this link 'https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/home.html'

From this link, you can see many file that were implemented by a group of professors

Our task is to implement files that haven't been coded with python 

It is finised in three weeks with work of each week like the following:

  First week:
  
    Learning Search algorithms
    
    We start to implement all uncoded functions in files search.py and searchAgents.py
    
  Second week:
  
    Learning Multi-Agents Search algorithms
    
    We implement all uncoded functions in file multiAgents.py
    
  Third week:
  
    Learning Reinforcement with machine learning
    
    We implement all uncoded functions in files valueIterationAgents.py and qlearningAgents.py
